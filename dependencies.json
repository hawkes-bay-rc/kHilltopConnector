	"// BE SURE TO REMOVE THESE COMMENTS BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE SINCE COMMENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN JSON. This file is a filesystem-level solution for specifying dependencies for packages. This is most useful for package developers since they are not installing their own packages from a repository or channel, and need to make sure Package Control installs the dependencies they need.  The file contains two levels of selectors, platform and Sublime Text version, to pick what set of dependencies should be installed. The most-specific selectors will be used, and all other ignored. This means that some dependencies will be duplicated under a specific platform and under *.  The first level of keys should be the value from sublime.platform(), or '*' for all platforms."
